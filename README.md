# PDF Presenter Lite

> **AI-assisted project.** This codebase was created with [Claude](https://claude.com/claude-code)
> (Anthropic), directed and reviewed by a human author — including architecture,
> implementation, and documentation. Review it accordingly before relying on it in
> production.

A minimal, single-purpose presenter tool: open a PDF, get a presenter view on one
screen (Now/Next preview plus a clickable slide thumbnail strip) and a clean
fullscreen output on a second screen — no notes panel, no NDI, no network
integrations. A stripped-down sibling of
[presentation-commander-client](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/presentation-commander-client),
keeping only its proven pdf.js rendering pipeline and multi-window/display-picker
pattern.

## Download

Prebuilt binaries are on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/pdf-presenter-lite/releases/latest),
covering both x64 and ARM64 on every platform — plus a combined "works on
either architecture" option for macOS and Windows if you'd rather not think
about which to pick:

- **macOS:** Universal (.dmg / .zip, runs on both Apple Silicon and Intel —
  recommended if unsure), or Apple Silicon-only / Intel-only for a smaller,
  single-architecture download. Unsigned, so Gatekeeper will block it on
  first launch. Right-click the app → Open, or run
  `xattr -cr "PDF Presenter Lite.app"` after extracting.
- **Windows:** a combined portable `.exe` covering both x64 and ARM64
  (recommended if unsure), or an x64-only / ARM64-only build for a smaller
  download. No installer either way, just run it directly. Unsigned, so
  SmartScreen will likely warn on first run ("More info" → "Run anyway").
- **Linux:** x64 or ARM64 (no combined option — `.deb`/`.rpm` packages are
  inherently single-architecture), as `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `.rpm`
  (Fedora/RHEL/openSUSE).

## What it does

- **Open a PDF** — renders locally with pdf.js, no other slide-source integrations
- **Presenter view** — a "Now" and "Next" preview side by side, plus a horizontal
  strip of thumbnails for every slide below them; click any thumbnail to jump
  straight to that slide
- **Keyboard navigation** — Left/Right, Up/Down, and Page Up/Page Down all
  move a slide; Space also advances
- **Mouse navigation** — a Previous/Next transport bar below the thumbnail
  strip, and clicking the "Next" preview itself jumps straight to it
- **Internal PDF link navigation** — links authored into the PDF itself (a
  table of contents, "back to agenda" links exported from PowerPoint/Keynote/
  Google Slides) become clickable on the "Now" slide, jumping straight to
  their target page. Reads link annotations via pdf.js, resolving each
  destination to a page number regardless of whether it's a named or explicit
  destination; only internal same-document links are wired up, external URLs
  are left alone
- **Fullscreen Output window** — a second, chrome-free window showing just the
  current slide, for a projector or confidence monitor. Pick which connected
  display it opens on from a dropdown next to the toggle button
- **Screen blanking** — press `B` or `W` to cut the Output window to solid
  black or white without losing your place, mirroring PowerPoint's presenter
  shortcuts; press again to restore the slide
- **Hide cursor on Output** — an optional checkbox that hides the OS mouse
  cursor whenever it's over the Output window, for a clean audience-facing
  display
- **OSC control** — a UDP OSC address space (slide navigation, black/white,
  Output open/close, system enable/disable) at `/pdfpresenter/...`, plain
  UDP rather than a Windows COM add-in, so it works on every platform this
  app ships for. A real Bitfocus Companion module ships alongside this app
  — [companion-module-pdf-presenter-lite](https://github.com/stoatworks-labs/companion-module-pdf-presenter-lite)
  — for driving it from a Stream Deck or any other Companion surface. An
  optional, off-by-default "watched folder" feature lets OSC open a
  specific PDF by filename without a dialog — useful for a button wall
  that loads a specific deck on cue. Sections are mapped from the PDF's
  own top-level outline/bookmarks — `goto/section` jumps straight to one.
  `/pdfpresenter/slideshow/laserpointer` mirrors the presenter's mouse
  position over the "Now" preview onto the Output window as a glowing dot,
  matching PowerPoint's own laser-pointer feature.
  `/pdfpresenter/slideshow/setwallpaper` renders the current slide and
  sets it as the desktop wallpaper on every connected monitor — macOS and
  Windows are fully covered, Linux is GNOME-only
- **Timed auto-advance** — an optional "advance every N seconds" mode
  (stops at the last slide rather than looping), with its own play/pause
  control next to the OSC settings — `/pdfpresenter/slideshow/pause` and
  `/resume` suspend/resume it remotely once it's turned on
- **Set as Default PDF App** — a titlebar button for making double-clicking
  a PDF open straight into this app. What it actually does differs by OS,
  since neither Windows nor macOS let a third-party app silently seize the
  default-app slot: on Windows it registers the app as a candidate then
  opens Settings for you to confirm; on macOS it registers with Launch
  Services and sets the default directly if `duti` is installed
  (`brew install duti`), otherwise shows the real manual steps; on Linux
  it's fully automatic via `xdg-mime`. The status message always says
  what actually happened, never a fake "done" when the real answer is
  "you still need to confirm it"

## Architecture

Two renderer views loaded from the same bundle, selected by a `mode` query param
(mirrors the Client Node's Program Out window pattern):

- `App.tsx` — the presenter view: loads the PDF, owns `currentPage`/`totalPages`,
  renders Now/Next + thumbnails, and pushes `{ data, currentPage }` to the Output
  window whenever it changes.
- `Output.tsx` — the fullscreen window. Pulls the current state via
  `output:get-state` once its own listener is mounted (rather than relying solely
  on a live push, which can race and get silently dropped if the window is still
  loading when the presenter pushes) and then stays in sync via `output:state`
  pushes for as long as it's open.

`pdf.ts` (the PDF loading/rendering helpers) is copied verbatim from
presentation-commander-client — same render-queue-per-canvas serialization to
avoid the transform-corruption bug documented there.

## Status

Built and verified end-to-end: opening a PDF, thumbnail-click navigation,
arrow-key navigation, and the fullscreen Output window (including a real race
condition in the initial state hand-off, found and fixed during testing) all
confirmed working against a real multi-page PDF.

## Inspiration & prior art

This app's OSC control feature (and, indirectly, its wallpaper-export
feature) was shaped by looking at how existing remote-PowerPoint-control
tools work. None of their code is reused here — this app has no PowerPoint
dependency at all, and two of the three are closed-source anyway — but it's
worth being upfront about where the ideas came from:

- **[OSCPoint](https://github.com/phuvf/oscpoint)** — a Windows PowerPoint
  add-in exposing an OSC API. It's closed-source, so nothing was copied from
  it; its public documentation (`ACTIONS.md`/`FEEDBACKS.md`/`EVENTS.md`) was
  read to design a comparable address space and the two-port
  (action-in/feedback-out) architecture this app uses. That address space
  originally mirrored OSCPoint's own (`/oscpoint/...`, matching ports) for
  drop-in Companion compatibility; it's since been renamed to
  `/pdfpresenter/...` and decoupled from OSCPoint entirely, now that this app
  has its own dedicated Companion module instead.
- **[Iris Down Remote Show Control](https://irisdown.co.uk/rsc.html)** — an
  older, separate commercial PowerPoint add-in taking plain ASCII text
  commands (`NEXT`, `PREV`, `GO`, `RUNCURRENT`, `SETBG`, …) over UDP/TCP,
  with no feedback channel at all. Its command set overlaps conceptually
  with several features here — slide navigation, starting from the current
  slide, and notably `SETBG`'s "set desktop wallpaper to the current slide,"
  which this app's own wallpaper-export feature does the same thing as.
  Nothing was read from its source (it isn't public) or its wire format
  (plain text vs. this app's OSC) — the overlap is in feature scope, not
  implementation.
